# SCARA
SCARA Robot Arm Project

Hey Fellows, 

If you found this. Then I am going to assume that you are part of the group.
If you have no idea who we are, then my student liscence on Github probably expired.

In that case welcome.

SCARA is a Robotic Arm Project where we create an interface to allow you the user to draw text on a page based off an image.
